### USB Protocol
Documentation is readily available for similar models in the same family as the PT-D600 label printer. Thankfully, there are only minimal differences in the protocol between the models. To further verify this, the data packets sent using the official drivers were captured and analyzed using a Hex Editor like ImHex Editor (which I highly recommend).
